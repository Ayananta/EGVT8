NOTE\nVitrified & Granite\nVitrified Tiles and Granite are heterogeneous materials containing veins, fissures and with\ntonal differences. Because of firing, slight variation from the standard colour is unavoidable\nfor Vitrified Tiles. There will be colour and markings caused by their complex mineral\ncomposition and incorporated impurities. As such, it is impossible to guarantee homogeneity. Granite slabs are pre-polished before laying and care will be taken for their installation. However granite being a hard material cannot be re-polished after installation. Hence, some\nimperfections may be seen at the joints. Although the vitrified and granite tiles/slabs are cut\nand produced by available standards of workmanship and machinery, the surfaces of these\nmaterials are not perfectly straight or flat and it is not always possible to avoid the resultant\ngaps/voids formed beneath the vitrified and granite tiles/slabs after installation. The tonality\nand pattern of vitrified or granite selected and installed shall be subject to availability. Warranties\nWhere warranties are given by the manufacturers and/or contractors and/or suppliers of any of\nthe equipment and/or appliances installed by the Vendor at the said Unit, the Vendor shall assign\nto the Purchaser such warranties at the time when possession of the said Unit is delivered to\nthe Purchaser..\n35\nAir-Conditioning\nAt the time of handover, in case of LT metering, the purchaser must apply for the electricity\nconnection from the concerned authority.",
