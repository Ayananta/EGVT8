Assuming that the flat owners of the 15 towers have given consent for the\nconstruction of the additional tower, will that give a license to the NKDA to\nabdicate their statutory duty of ascertaining whether the promoter has the\nexclusive right to construct? If so done by the NKDA, as done in the present\ncase, the same would amount to a violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of\nIndia. This reasoning has been tested in Basheshar Nath v. CIT, reported in\n1958 SCC OnLine SC 7, and it was held that the surrender by the citizen of his\nright does not give a license to an Art 12 authority to also act in breach of its\nobligation in performance of which it is supposed the enforce the surrendered\nright of the citizen.",

Under our constitutional\nscheme, compliance with a fair procedure of law before depriving any person\nof his immovable property is well entrenched. We are examining this issue in\nthe context of Section 352 of the Act which is bereft of any procedure\nwhatsoever before compulsorily acquiring private property. Again, assuming\nthat Section 363 of the Act provides for compensation, compulsory acquisition\nwill still be unconstitutional if proper procedure is not established or followed\nbefore depriving a person of their right to property. We find it compelling to\nclarify that a rather undue emphasis is laid on provisions of\ncompensation to justify the power of compulsory acquisition, as if\ncompensation by itself is the complete procedure for a valid\nacquisition.",
